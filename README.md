### What will happen when the day in `counter.js` comes?  

You might feel curious about the default date written in counter.js. It will be a special day for both the project and the one it was originally dedicated to.  

All countdown timers come to an end.  And the end of this timer may also be the end of my contribution to this project.  

I guess I would be too tired when the moment comes.  

**However, there would be no death for any open-source project.** Feel free to fork the project, modify it and deploy it to your needs. I also welcome all pull requests from anyone willing to help with the project.

***WORK IN PROGRESS!!*** Although the latest version of counter-down is already working and production-ready, some intended features are still under construction. Good news: all features on the main branch are estimated to be completed before October 2023. See `// TODO` for an insight.
